My real name is Hans Elias Bukholm Josephsen, but on the internet I have always gone by hansihe. At the moment I live in a small town in Norway, the place where I grew up, but I am preparing to move out into the world soon.

I am a self taught developer who has been working with computers my whole life. I work in several programming languages, but my favorites at the moment are [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.com), [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) and [Python](http://python.org). When I start a new project, I always try to choose the technologies that is best suited, and I always love learning something new.

Outside of software development I love tinkering with electronics.

For examples of my work, have a look at my [projects](/projects) page or my [github](https://github.com/hansihe).
